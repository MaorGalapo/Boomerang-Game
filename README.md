# Boomerang-Game
A mobile game I created in 2021
Controls are simple tap or hold the right part of the screen to switch direction or "float" in it, and tap the left part of the screen to attack.
I have implemented power ups (slow-motion, attack speedup, teleport, boost) and different attack types (tho the attack types aren't achievable through gameplay and can be tested in code [change in weapon controller script manually]).

There is also a shop and destroyable obstacles (the trees with a leaf and no spikes on them).


All Visual assets were created by me exept the water beackground that i created with the help of Daniel llett video :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHy3rSKtRmc&t=228s
